ForceSharpShadows = 0                    ; Forces the shadows to be sharp in texture formats that force soft shadows (INTZ, DF16 and DF24). This will cause more visible shadow pop-in, but result in much sharper stencil shadows.
RainDropletsScale = 0.5                  ; Adjusts the size of the on-screen rain droplets.
DisableMotionBlur = 0                    ; Allows users to disable motion blur without changing registry settings.
LightStreaksEnable = 0                   ; Leftover from NFS Underground 2. Enables the light trail effect. Not very visible at higher FPS than 60, but it does make the flares more saturated in color.
BleachByPassEnable = 0                   ; (EXPERIMENTAL) Leftover from NFS Underground 2. Enables the "Enhanced Contrast" effect. Requires the IDI_SCREENFILTER_FX shader from Underground 2 to work. If you do not have it, the screen will be blurry!
ForcedGPUVendor = 0x10DE                 ; Force the GPU PCI VendorID here. This will affect the renderer and video options behavior. (0 = Disabled | 0x10DE = NVIDIA (Default) | 0x1002 = ATI/AMD | 0x8086 = Intel)

CustomNOSTrailLength = 1.0               ; Adjusts the total distance of the NOS trail. You may need to adjust this if you're playing at very high FPS (240+). The higher the SimRate & FPS difference, the longer the trail.
FixNOSTrailPosition = 0                  ; Requires FixNOSTrailLength to be enabled. This will attempt to fix the trail from clipping the car by scaling its position away from the car.
NOSTrailPositionScalar = 0.3             ; Requires FixNOSTrailPosition to be enabled. This controls the trail position relative to the tail lights.
